  <body>
  <p>Please try out the above <strong>Navigation Buttons</strong>!</p>

  <h2> Description of this website</h2>
  <p>   This is a website bulid in github.com using HTML coding. It will continue to evolve as we learn more advanced commands and in the end look much different I'm sure. For now it
    is a place to see what the HTML displays from the different commands I am learning. At the moment the website has (4) images which had to be saved on the my github server to be
    displayed here. Each button above should bring you to different locations where the button describes the information contained. Below this description paragraph I have included
    notes on what I have learn so far with some practice to help me remember the commands. To view the HTML code you can right click anywhere on this webpage and from that menu click 
    Inspect Element or View Page Source.
  </p>
  <h3> How did I made this website?</h3>
  <p>   I started by very carefully listening to the assigned videos from Khan Academy. As I took notes I started to better understand how and why HTML commands are used to tell the 
    browser what to display. There were a good number of different commands covered such as how to <strong>Bold Text</strong>, <em>Italics</em>, build headers, paragraphs, lists,
    tables, links, and add images.<br>
  <strong>This is my first ever website so hopefully I can use this Homepage and continue to update the information contained</strong>.
