  <h2> Description of this website</h2>
  <p> This is a website bulid in github.com using HTML coding. It will continue to evolve as we learn more advanced commands and in the end look much different I'm sure. For now it
    is a place to see what the HTML display the different commands I am learning. That the moment the website has (4) images which had to be saved on the my github server to be
    displayed here. 
  </p>
  <h3> How did I made this website?</h3>
  <p> I started by very carefully listening to the assigned videos from Khan Academy. As I took notes I start to better understand how and why HTML commands are used to tell the 
    browser what to display. There were a good number of different commands covered such as how to <strong>Bold Text</strong>, <em>Italics</em>, build headers, paragraphs, lists,
    tables, links, and add images.<br>
  <strong>This is my first ever Website so hopefully I can use this Homepage and continue to update the information contained</strong>.
