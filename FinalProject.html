  <h1>  Welcome to Derrien's Final Project webpage! </h1>
  <p>   This page contains a Javascript app I made with my partner Neil Macleod in my CSC 106 course at the University of Rhode Island. Our final project we decided on was to build 
    a Sudoku application and what you see below is what it evolved into. We used every aspect of programming we learned over the semester to create this game with 3 different 
    difficulties to try.
  </p>
      <h1> How to use the app: </h1>
      <p> Simply click on the difficulty you would like to try to start one of our 3 puzzles. If you would like a reminder of how to play Sudoku please use the “How to Play” button. 
        When you enter the game, you will see 1-9 buttons at the bottom of the game screen click on the number you would like to place in each block to select it and then click on the
        block you would like to input the selected number. You will notice that the selected number will be highlighted in orange. You do not need to reselect a number if you wish to
        use it for multiple blocks as it will stay selected until changed. We have included a “Check Answers” button which can be used at any time. If you choose the easy puzzle the 
        logics for the check button are always active and the block will turn green when you enter the correct number. NOTE: If you play on intermediate or hard once the check answer 
        button is clicked the blocks will remain the color they appeared when the button was last pressed. You can however click the “Check Answer” button again to have the program 
        recheck your entries.
      </p>
