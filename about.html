     <h1>  Welcome to the About Me page! </h1>
    <p> My name is Derrien Walters. I am a CSC106 student this year at <a href="https://uri.edu"><strong>URI</strong></a>. I am honored to have served in the U.S. Navy's Submarine Force for 
      more than 12 years. I was fortunate to have been stationed in Hawaii for the later part of my career and that is where I learned to surf.
      I am currently persuing a Compuer Science degree with a minor in Business. My focus is on schooling currently but I am open to job offers.
    </p>
    <p> I enjoy logic based games and activities. My wife and I have two children, two cat, two dogs.
